On this Playground, you will configure the 'AcousticShip' game. In the next few pages, I'll show you how to customize your game mechanics so you can set the difficulty and mechanics to make your game more fun!

## Background

In the 22nd century, humans learned the secrets of sound and developed techniques for exploring space through the study of sound.
In this day and age, spacecraft are powered by sound.

As a member of the human alliance spacecraft patrol, you encountered a meteorite belt during your patrol today. How can you get through it? Run the code to challenge it!

## Game Instructions

1. Every time the warplane launches a missile it needs to use sound to power it, make your sound to launch the missile.

2. The top left corner of the screen is the warplane's health, each time you hit a meteorite will be deducted 1 point, once the light your ship will crash in the meteorite belt!

3. The top right corner of the screen is the waveform of the sound, and when it shows a large amplitude, it means that you have provided enough energy for the missile.

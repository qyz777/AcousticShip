 Goal: Set meteorites
 
 Your task is to set the location of the meteorite entering from the outside of the screen and its style.
 
 The `setupMeteorolite` function returns the central x coordinate of the meteorite's appearance by passing in the screen width and the meteorite's size.
 
 The `setupMeteoroliteStyle` function returns the style of the meteorite by passing in the index of the meteorite to appear.
 
 Please try to design it so that different meteorites appear in different places!

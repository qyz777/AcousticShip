# AcousticShip

## Introduction

![Introduction](./resource/introduction.gif)

AcousticShip is a game designed by sound. In this game, you need to pilot a space plane through the meteorite cluster. The fighter's weapons are controlled by your voice, and when your voice reaches a certain decibel level, it fires missiles.

I use AVFoundation, UIKit and PlaygroundSupport in this playground.
